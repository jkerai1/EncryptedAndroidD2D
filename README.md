# EncryptedAndroidD2D

The aim of this project is to create a mobile phone application which will allow two users to 
communicate securely using Wi-Fi Direct. This would allow for communication without a server. This 
would stop traffic being routed through the internet, eliminating any attacker who is not in the 
vicinity of the devices operating. In the end I decided to NOT use firebase for my solution. This project is more of a proof of concept than for a real world deployment.
